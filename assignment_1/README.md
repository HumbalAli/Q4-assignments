# Assignment 1: Webpage Recreation with Gemini CLI

This project was created and developed using the Gemini CLI, following a series of interactive commands and instructions.

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to recreate a given image as a functional webpage using only HTML and CSS. Initially, the request was to display the image, but it evolved into a more complex task of converting the visual design of the image into pure HTML and CSS code, including layout, styling, and interactive elements.

## Creation Process

The development process involved the following key steps, all executed through the Gemini CLI:

1.  **Initial Setup**: The Gemini CLI was used to understand the initial request and set up the project environment.
2.  **HTML Structure Generation**: An `index.html` file was created to lay out the basic structure of the webpage, including a header, navigation, main content area, and action buttons.
3.  **CSS Styling**: A `style.css` file was developed to style the HTML elements, aiming to match the visual appearance of the provided image. This included:
    *   Applying a gradient background to the `body`.
    *   Styling the header, logo, navigation links, and buttons.
    *   Centering the main content and styling the headings and paragraphs.
    *   Styling the action buttons to resemble those in the image.
4.  **Icon Integration**: Upon user request, icons (text, shapes, and graduation cap) were added to the `index.html` using Font Awesome. The Font Awesome CDN was integrated into the HTML, and corresponding CSS was added to `style.css` to style and position these icons.
5.  **Git Repository Management**: The Gemini CLI was used to initialize a Git repository, stage and commit changes, and push the entire project to a GitHub repository. This included:
    *   Initializing `git` in the project directory.
    *   Committing initial HTML and CSS.
    *   Restructuring the project into an `assignment_1` directory.
    *   Committing the updated HTML/CSS with icons.
    *   Pushing all changes to the specified GitHub repository.

## How to View

To view the recreated webpage, simply open the `assignment_1/index.html` file in your web browser.

## Deployment

This project was also prepared for deployment to Vercel, with instructions provided by the Gemini CLI for the user to complete the deployment process.
